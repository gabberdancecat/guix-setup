#+TITLE: notes to self


* TODO before restarting:

- backup home dir
- backup ALL dots and code
- backup keepassxc database
- backup librewolf and arkenfox bookmarks
- backup flatpak data

* For reinstallation:

create a install script for easy install (or rather a list of commands to read off of)

follow rde installation tutorial

* Post-installation

make sure EVERYTHING is reproducible, in case this happens again

make snapshotting and store integrity-checking system, daily, or at least very frequently

.guix-profile is never updated, only .guix-extra-profiles. edit the script to ensure that the default profile is being upgraded as well!
