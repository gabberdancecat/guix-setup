#+TITLE: notes to self


* TODO before restarting:

- backup home dir
- backup ALL dots and code
- backup keepassxc database
- backup librewolf and arkenfox bookmarks
- backup flatpak data

* For reinstallation:

create a install script for easy install (or rather a list of commands to read off of)

follow rde installation tutorial

* Post-installation

make sure EVERYTHING is reproducible, in case this happens again

make snapshotting and store integrity-checking system, daily, or at least very frequently

.guix-profile is never updated, only .guix-extra-profiles. edit the script to ensure that the default profile is being upgraded as well!

remove x display manager replace with xinit
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-guix/2018-07/msg00080.html
remove gdm, then read the contents of %desktop-services if being used, using trick showed in rde video tutorial, reading contents of variable in system config file.
- also, modify the guix-system-reconfigure script by showing the actual command that is run, so can learn.

* TODO Now

- [ ] auto guix upkeep script: verify store integrity, btrfs snapshotting with snapper, make sure guix default profile is being updated, not just the extra profiles (rewrite update script?).
- [X] Restore firefox bookmarks and add new ones from other laptop
- [ ] save new nyanko.scm
  - [ ] FIX GIT GPG ACCESS
- [ ] create modules for stow dotfiles, then move dotfiles into nya repo, use stow layout
- [ ] complete river config
- [ ] (NEXT WEEK) Create persist subvol from chroot, reconfigure, if work, try adding keyfile in /persist/key-file.cpio, hope it works.
- [ ] test if zstd format works, only in root subvol (also noatime? what does that even do?)
- [ ] create script for volume-up key, check if current volume is <= 100, if yes, allow inc script arg amount, check val again, if over 100, set back to 100

Long future:
- improve and neaten arkenfox overrides into neater form
  - arkenfox-updater, keep expected firefox version in file, compare to output of "firefox --version" | regex !
- combine nya and channel repos in ~/src
- improve look of nyanko.scm, split into modules maybe
- Move some things in .dotfiles into guix-home
- figure out a way to fix stumpwm root user (get river all set up beforehand)
- vpn shuffle through mullvad vpns, set all to don't autoconnect except one random, will update next wake from sleep

-
