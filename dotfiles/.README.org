#+title: dotfiles!

These are my dotfiles.

Main attractions:
- Wayland compositor configs
- X window manager configs
- all my shellscripts
- my old emacs configs (obsolete)
- and more

  
Some personal notes:

- * Dont use .stow-local-ignore, bc not interoperable with guix home-dotfiles-service!
  
- stow commands:
  - =-n= test
  - =-D= delete stowed
  - =-R= restow 

- to stow all:
  - =stow -nv ./*=
    =stow ./*=
